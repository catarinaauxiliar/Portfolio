**Professional Portfolio**

**By Catarina Martins**

This portfolio contains the projects that were developed during my master’s
degree in Data Analysis and Decision Support Systems, and exceptionally one
project that I developed during my bachelor’s degree, but I considered important
to add, since it was the beginning of my journey in the field.

The projects mentioned here are all uploaded into GitHub - along with other
projects I did during my course - where they are organized through field, so you
can choose the fields that you specifically want with ease. However, in this file I
organized them through date, so you can see the progress of my work.

It is important to highlight that, unfortunately, the projects are mostly done in my
mother language (Portuguese). Nevertheless, through this document I give a
brief explanation of what they consist of, and I am gladly at your disposal to talk
about each of them individually.

**Project 1 – “Investigation project – Operational Program for Human
Capital” - 2023**

This class gave me an introduction to data, and I can say that it is the one that
inspired me to pursue this field professionally. Here I learned foundational Excel
skills and developed a project using Power BI.
The focus of this project was to learn basic Power BI interactions, practice data
storytelling and understand how to build meaningful visual narratives.
For the project, we investigated the use of European Union funds under
Portugal’s Operational Program for Human Capital (POCH), analysing how these
funds were allocated and used across different sectors.

**Case Studies for Statistical Data Analysis - 2024**

This course gave me my first hands-on experience with statistical analysis using
SPSS. I worked on two case studies that helped me understand how data can
support real-world decision-making.

In the first, we analysed coffee sales in a retail chain to identify which factors
influenced performance — marketing investment stood out as the most
significant. In the second, we applied factor analysis to study airline passenger
satisfaction, and multiple regression to explore what drives household electricity
consumption.

These projects helped me build a solid foundation in applied statistics and
showed me the value of using data to extract meaningful insights.

**Project 2 – “Crime prediction in the city of Los Angeles” - 2025**

In this project, we used Apache Spark and Python to analyse over two million
crime records in Los Angeles, with the goal of predicting the number of crimes
per area.

The work was structured in three main phases: selecting and understanding the
dataset, cleaning and transforming the data, and finally training and evaluating
machine learning models. This project allowed me to apply Big Data and ML
techniques using Python in a real-world, large-scale scenario with geographic
and temporal complexity.

**Project 3 – “Mix of production problem for the maximization of the
profit” - 2025**

This project focused on solving a classic production mix problem for a factory
producing five types of electronic devices: Smartphones, Tablets, Notebooks,
Smartwatches, and Game Consoles.

Using Python and the PuLP library, we built a linear programming model to
determine the optimal monthly production quantities over a 12-month period, with
the goal of maximizing total profit. The model considered multiple realistic
constraints, including resource limits, market demand, storage, and production
capacities.

This project gave me practical experience in applying operations research
techniques to real business scenarios and strengthened my ability to use
optimization tools for strategic decision-making.
